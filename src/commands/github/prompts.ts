const SAFETY_RULES = `## GitHub Safety Protocol

- NEVER edit git config or rewrite history (no rebase -i, no force-push to main/master).
- NEVER skip hooks (--no-verify, --no-gpg-sign) unless the user explicitly asked.
- NEVER commit secret-bearing files (.env, *.pem, credentials.json) — warn the user instead.
- ALWAYS create NEW commits, never amend, unless the user explicitly asked.
- If you are about to take a write action that crosses the network (push, gh pr create, gh release create, gh workflow run, closing/labelling an issue), confirm the plan with the user FIRST unless they have already authorized it in this turn.
- Use HEREDOC for multi-line commit/PR/release bodies so quoting stays clean.`

- \`/github pr <url|#number>\` — review a pull request and surface the Good / Bad / Ugly
- \`/github wrap [--branch=<name>] [--issue=<n>] [instructions]\` — commit, push, optionally close an issue, update changelog

${parsedHint}

${SAFETY_RULES}

## Your task

Run these steps in order. Do NOT skip ahead. The whole point of the ordering is to avoid \`gh\` commands that will fail visibly — diagnose first, act only when safe.

### Step 1: Read the issue

1. Resolve the target repo:
   - URL target → use the \`<owner>/<repo>\` from the parsed hint above; pass \`--repo <owner>/<repo>\` on every \`gh\` call.
   - Number target → resolve current repo once: \`gh repo view --json nameWithOwner -q .nameWithOwner\`.
2. Fetch the issue:
   \`gh issue view <number> [--repo <owner/repo>] --json number,title,body,state,labels,assignees,author,comments\`
3. If \`state\` is \`CLOSED\`, tell the user the issue is already closed and STOP — do not relabel it.

### Step 2: Check write permission (silent)

Run exactly one check before touching any labels:
\`\`\`
gh api "repos/<owner>/<repo>" --jq '.permissions.push // false' 2>/dev/null || echo false
\`\`\`
- Output \`true\` → you have write access (author / collaborator / maintainer) → proceed to Step 3.
- Output \`false\` or empty → you do NOT have write access → SKIP Step 3 entirely and jump straight to Step 4. Do NOT attempt \`gh issue edit\`, \`gh label create\`, or any label-mutating call — they would fail and clutter the output.

### Step 3: Apply labels by category and criticality (only if Step 2 returned \`true\`)

1. List the repo's existing labels once: \`gh label list [--repo <owner/repo>] --limit 100 --json name --jq '.[].name'\`. Hold the set in memory.
2. From the issue body, decide which labels apply — only ones already in that set:
   - **Category** — \`bug\`, \`enhancement\`, \`documentation\`, \`question\`, or \`chore\`.
   - **Criticality** — only if labels like \`P0\`/\`P1\`/\`P2\`, \`high priority\`, \`critical\`, \`low priority\` exist in the set. Be conservative: \`high\`/\`critical\`/\`P0\` is reserved for broken core flows, security holes, or data loss.
   - **Status** — \`in progress\` if it exists.
3. Apply each chosen label with:
   \`gh issue edit <n> [--repo ...] --add-label "<name>" 2>/dev/null || true\`
   Do NOT create new labels. If a label you wanted is missing from the set, silently skip it.

### Step 4: Describe the issue (always — both URL and number paths)

Read every signal attached to the issue:
- Title, body, and every comment.
- Image attachments — extract URLs from \`![](url)\` and \`<img src="url">\` blocks. Use the URL VERBATIM (do not append a stray \`.\`, \`,\`, \`)\`, or any trailing punctuation that markdown rendering may have left behind). Fetch each image ONCE with \`WebFetch\`. If it 404s or times out, write "attachment unavailable" and move on — never retry the same URL.
- PDFs / file attachments linked in the body — same one-shot fetch rule.

If the issue body is *only* an image and that image is unreachable, reply: "Cannot describe the issue — the only attachment is unreachable. Please paste the error text or describe the screenshot." Then STOP. Do NOT speculate about the bug.

Otherwise, write a 2–4 sentence **Description** that captures: what the user is reporting, key error messages or screenshot contents, and any reproduction steps the issue mentions.

## Your task

1. Read the PR metadata: \`gh pr view <number> [--repo <owner/repo>] --json number,title,author,state,isDraft,baseRefName,headRefName,additions,deletions,changedFiles,labels,reviews,reviewRequests,statusCheckRollup,body\`.
2. Read the diff: \`gh pr diff <number> [--repo <owner/repo>]\`.
3. Read existing review comments and conversation: \`gh pr view <number> --comments\` and, if relevant, \`gh api repos/<owner>/<repo>/pulls/<number>/comments\`.
4. Audit:
   - **Tests:** were tests added or updated? Are they meaningful, or token boxes?
   - **Docs:** did public-facing behavior change without a doc / README / CHANGELOG update?
   - **Risk:** any new dependencies, schema migrations, security-sensitive code (auth, crypto, file IO, shell exec, eval), or breaking API changes?
   - **CI:** any failed required checks (\`statusCheckRollup\`)?
5. Reply with the **Good / Bad / Ugly** report:
   - **Good** — what is solid and ready to ship.
   - **Bad** — meaningful problems the author should fix before merge (missing tests, missing docs, regressions, unsafe patterns).
   - **Ugly** — nits, style, naming, dead code — clearly marked as optional.
   Cite \`file:line\` for every Bad / Ugly point. End with a one-line verdict: "approve / request-changes / comment".

DO NOT post the review to GitHub, do NOT \`gh pr review\`, do NOT comment on the PR. The user reads your report and decides.`

## Your task

Run these in order. STOP at any prompt that says "ask the user".

1. **Survey** — \`git status\`, \`git diff HEAD\`, \`git log --oneline -10\` so you understand what is staged and the local commit style.
2. **Branch** — handle the branch section above. Never commit to \`main\` / \`master\` without explicit user confirmation.
3. **Compose commit** — short imperative subject (≤72 chars), blank line, bullet body explaining *why*, blank line, then the \`Closes #N\` trailer if applicable. Match the repo's existing commit style. Use HEREDOC:
   \`\`\`
   git commit -m "$(cat <<'EOF'
   <subject>

   - <bullet 1>
   - <bullet 2>

   Closes #N
   EOF
   )"
   \`\`\`
4. **Stage + commit** — only files relevant to this change. Skip anything that smells like a secret. If nothing is staged, tell the user and stop.
5. **Changelog** — if a top-level \`CHANGELOG.md\` exists, append a one-line entry under the \`## [Unreleased]\` section (create the section if missing). Stage and amend it INTO the same commit only if you have not pushed yet — otherwise add it as a follow-up commit. If no changelog file exists, skip silently.
6. **Push** — \`git push -u origin <branch>\`. If the push is rejected (non-fast-forward), STOP and tell the user — do not force-push.
7. **Report** — reply with: branch name, commit SHA, commit subject, link to the issue (if any), and the \`gh pr create\` command they could run next (do not run it yourself).`

${SAFETY_RULES}

## Your task

1. **Find the boundary**:
   - Latest tag: \`git describe --tags --abbrev=0\` (if no tags exist, fall back to the first commit on this branch).
   - HEAD: \`git rev-parse HEAD\`.
2. **Collect commits**: \`git log <last-tag>..HEAD --pretty=format:"%H|%s|%an"\`. Skip merge commits (\`--no-merges\`).
3. **Read \`CHANGELOG.md\`** if it exists. Note the format (Keep-a-Changelog, conventional, plain bullets) so your draft matches.
4. **Categorize** every commit into:
   - **Added** — new features
   - **Changed** — enhancements to existing features
   - **Fixed** — bug fixes
   - **Removed** — removals
   - **Security** — security-relevant fixes
   - **Docs / Chore / Internal** — group at the bottom (or omit if the project's style does)
   Use commit messages, but if a subject is uninformative, run \`git show --stat <sha>\` and infer from the diff.
5. **Detect missing entries**: for each commit, check whether the existing \`CHANGELOG.md\` already mentions it. List any that were merged but never recorded.
6. **Draft the new section** for the next release. Use the project's existing format. Mark the version as \`[Unreleased]\` unless the user told you a target version${trimmed ? ` (they passed: \`${trimmed}\`)` : ''}.
7. **Reply** with:
   - The proposed new section (markdown, ready to paste).
   - A bullet list of "missed" commits that were merged but never made it into the changelog.
   - The question: "Write this to CHANGELOG.md now?" — STOP.

1. **Resolve repo**: \`gh repo view --json nameWithOwner -q .nameWithOwner\`.
2. **Pull issues**: \`gh issue list --state open --limit 100 --json number,title,body,labels,assignees,createdAt,author\`. If a scope was given above, filter accordingly (e.g. \`--label\`, \`--search\`).
3. **Pull existing labels**: \`gh label list --limit 100 --json name,description,color\` — only apply labels that already exist. If a needed label is missing, ASK the user before creating it.
4. **For each issue**, classify:
   - **Type** — bug, enhancement, documentation, question, chore.
   - **Priority** — high (broken core flow / security / data loss), medium (degraded UX, blocking few users), low (cosmetic, nice-to-have). Be conservative on "high".
   - **Duplicate** — search older issues by title keywords (\`gh issue list --search "<keywords>" --state all\`). If you find a high-confidence duplicate, note it.
   - **Suggested assignee** — for code-related issues, run \`git log --pretty=format:"%an" -- <relevant-file> | head -10 | sort | uniq -c | sort -rn\` to find the most recent contributor on the affected area. Suggest only — do NOT assign.
5. **Build a triage table** in markdown:
   | # | Title | Type | Priority | Action | Notes |
   Action is one of: \`label\`, \`close as duplicate of #N\`, \`needs info\`, \`assign to @user\` (suggestion only).
6. **Show the table to the user and STOP.** Then ask: "Apply these labels and close the duplicates? (yes / partial — give me numbers)".
7. **On user approval**, batch-apply with \`gh issue edit <n> --add-label "<label>"\` and \`gh issue close <n> --comment "Duplicate of #M"\` for the approved subset only. Print a one-line summary per change.

NEVER auto-close, auto-assign, or auto-label without the user's explicit yes.`

## Your task

Walk these steps in order. STOP at every checkpoint that says "ASK".

1. **Pre-flight**:
   - \`git status\` — must be clean. If dirty, STOP and tell the user.
   - \`git branch --show-current\` — must be the project's main branch (\`main\` or \`master\`). If not, ASK before continuing.
   - \`git fetch --tags\` then \`git pull --ff-only\` to make sure local matches remote. If the pull is not fast-forward, STOP.
   - \`gh pr checks <main-branch>\` if the project gates releases on green CI — STOP if any required check is failing.
2. **Build changelog notes**: same logic as \`/github changelog\` — diff against last tag, categorize, format. Hold the notes in memory; do NOT write them yet.
3. **ASK** the user to confirm: version number, list of changes, target branch. Show the proposed notes inline. STOP and wait.
4. **On approval**, in this exact order:
   - Update \`CHANGELOG.md\`: move \`[Unreleased]\` content under the new version + today's date, leave a fresh empty \`[Unreleased]\` on top. Commit: \`chore(release): <version>\`.
   - Tag: \`git tag -a <version> -m "<version>"\`.
   - Push: \`git push origin <main-branch>\` then \`git push origin <version>\`.
   - GitHub release: \`gh release create <version> --title "<version>" --notes-file <(printf '%s' "$NOTES")\` (or \`--notes\` with a heredoc). Mark it as latest unless the user said otherwise.
5. **Deploy hook**: list available workflows with \`gh workflow list\`. If a release/deploy workflow exists, ASK the user "Run \`<workflow>\` against tag <version>?" before \`gh workflow run\`. Do not assume.
6. **Report**: print the release URL (\`gh release view <version> --json url -q .url\`), the tag SHA, and the workflow run URL if you triggered one.

If anything in steps 4–5 fails after the tag has been pushed, STOP and surface the exact error — do NOT try to clean up by deleting the tag without asking.`
