Do the read quietly; do not send routine "let me read" narration to the user. To change only part of a file, use the Edit tool instead (it reads + edits in place).`

Usage:
- This tool will overwrite the existing file if there is one at the provided path.${getPreReadInstruction()}
- Prefer the Edit tool for modifying existing files \u2014 it only sends the diff. Only use this tool to create new files or for complete rewrites.
- NEVER create documentation files (*.md) or README files unless explicitly requested by the User.
- Only use emojis if the user explicitly requests it. Avoid writing emojis to files unless asked.`
